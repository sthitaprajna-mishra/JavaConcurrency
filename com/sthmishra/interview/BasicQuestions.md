# Basic Java Interview Questions

### 1. What is class and object? 

#### **Class**

A class can be understood as a template or a blueprint, which contains some values, known as data members, and some set of rules, known as behaviors or methods. 

#### **Objects**

An object is an instance of a class. It is a specific entity created from the class, and it represents a real-world concept. 

In simpler terms, a **class defines the structure and behavior**, while an **object is an actual representation of that structure in memory**.
